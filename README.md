Here we code to find the linear regression patterns between Latitude and various weather paterns ie. Humitidy, wind speed, cloudiness.

There is no strong relationship between the Latitude and the various weather paterns but more area's closer to the equator can see warmer temperatures, slightly higher wind speed.  Both Northern and Southern Hemisphere can see an intense cloud cover, even up to 100%

Included in this work is Vacation areas based on my ideal humitity percentage. 

This code is linked direct to the weather api website.  When refreshed, the informaiton will change depending on what cities / countries weather paterns are at the time.  Your analysis may change each time you refresh the code.
